DialoGPT is a large-scale pre-trained dialogue response generation model developed by Microsoft, designed for multiturn conversations. It enables the creation of open-domain chatbots that can deliver engaging and natural conversational responses. With DialoGPT, you can build conversational interfaces that can understand and respond to user input in a more human-like way.

DialoGPT is trained on a massive dataset of 147 million multi-turn dialogues from Reddit discussion threads, allowing it to learn the nuances of human conversation and generate responses that are contextually relevant and coherent.
